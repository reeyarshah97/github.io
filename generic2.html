							<p> You are my support and my strength. Thank you for all the good moments that you brought into my life. Happy birthday, Queen and I wish you all the best. ~ Vraj Patel</p>
							<p> Happy 22nd Best Friend!! Hope you have the best day and year to come! Couldn’t image going through life without a fun, supporting, funny (sorta) friend like you 😊 I know you’re going to do AMAZING things in the future and I can’t wait to continue rooting for you ❤️ ~ Masuam Patel</p>
							<p> Hey Reeya!! I love you loads and o want you to have the happiest birthday I can’t wait to make this week all about you 🙂 Needless to say, I can make this longer but I’ll tell you in person ~ Dhvani Patel</p>
							<p> Happy Birthday Reeya! You’re one of the sweetest people that I’ve met and I honestly wish I’d met you sooner! I hope you have the best birthday my Amazon shopping buddy. ~ Drausty patel</p>
							<p> Happy Birthday Reeya, I’m so glad I got to know you better! You make going raas more fun. Hope you have a great year. ~ Manasvi Savani</p>
							<p> Wow friend! And just like that we are turning 22! Having you as a friend is such a blessing. Freshman year wouldn’t have been the same without having you to share so many laughs, dinner dates, and spontaneous dance parties. Yet, even though we aren’t just the throw of a pillow away, I love getting to reminisce with you and hear all about your current life stories. Keep being you friend (unless you can be a banana then be a banana, unless your mom throws your dreams in the trash). So much love ~ Rachel Biamonte </p>
							<p> Hey Reeya, I hope you have an amazing birthday! I’m excited to see you start optometry school and start the next part of your life. Love u! - Rohan Shah</p>
